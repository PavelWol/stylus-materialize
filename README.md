# Stylus Materialize
A [Stylus CSS](http://stylus-lang.com/) framework based on [Google Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/). Although inspired by the SASS [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com) framework, Stylus Materialize is a fresh implementation specificaly for the Stylus community.


## Development:
Stylus Materialize is in early development. If you'd like to contribute, feel free to fork and PR. I will be updating the README with a TODO list. Materilize is being developed by systematically parsing through the Material Design guidlines and creating the equivelant CSS using Stylus. Some inspiration will be taken from MaterializeCSS to speed things along. (Unlike MaterializeCSS, this framework will be independent of its public website and its documentation so that it can be cleanly incorporated into your projects.)

## Installation:
Installation will be through Node npm. Package TBA.

## Notes:
Currently in early development. First code uploads coming soon.
